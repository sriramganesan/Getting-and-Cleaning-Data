The attached R script (run_analysis.R) performs merging and cleaning up of data as below:

1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set, namely: 

X - which gives 10299 x 561 data frame, as in the original description ("Number of Instances: 10299" and "Number of Attributes: 561")

S - resulting in a 10299 x 1 data frame with subject IDs,

Y -  resulting also in a 10299 x 1 data frame with activity IDs.

2. In step 2, the program reads file features.txt and extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

The resultng featuresData dataframe is a 10299 x 66 data frame. In our combined data set, 66 out of 561 attributes are measurements on the mean and standard deviation. The number of observations remains the same. We are just filtering out mean and std attributes from the combined data

All measurements taken are in the format of floating point numbers in the range (-1, 1)

3. In step 3 of the project, the code reads activity_labels.txt for descriptive activity names and apply them to the activity data set. The descriptive names provides human-readable format for looking at the data.  The descriptive activity names are: 

WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING

4. In addition to providing descriptive activity names, the code also modifies labels the data set with descriptive names using string manipulation functions: 

feature names (attributes) and activity names are converted to lower case, underscores and brackets () are removed in step 2 and 3. Activity lables are provided descriptive names in step 3. Once data is cleaned up, step 4 merges 10299x66 data frame containing 'features' with 10299x1 data frames containing 'activity' labels and 'subject' IDs.

The result is saved as merged_dataset.txt, a 10299x68 data frame such that the first column contains subject IDs, the second column activity names, and the last 66 columns are measurements.

Subject IDs are integers between 1 and 30 inclusive. Names of the attributes are as follows

tbodyacc-mean-x

tbodyacc-mean-y

tbodyacc-mean-z

tbodyacc-std-x

tbodyacc-std-y

tbodyacc-std-z

tgravityacc-mean-x

tgravityacc-mean-y

5. In step 5, the program code creates a second tidy data set with average of each measurement for each activity and each subject.
The tidy data set result is saved as data_set_with_mean.txt. The tidy data set is a 180x68 data frame. 

The first column contains subject IDs; the second column contains activity names; the third column contains the averages for each of the 66 attributes are in columns 3. There are 30 subjects and 6 activities, thus 180 rows in this data set with averages.
